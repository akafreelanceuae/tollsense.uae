## 1. üéØ Product Overview

### **Product Name:**

**TollSense UAE**

### **Tagline:**

*‚ÄúDrive smart. Pay less. Never miss a Salik or Darb toll again.‚Äù*

### **Vision:**

To be the **AI-powered toll companion** that helps UAE drivers, delivery fleets, and expats monitor, optimize, and reduce toll expenses across **Salik (Dubai)** and **Darb (Abu Dhabi)** systems ‚Äî all in one unified dashboard.

### **Mission:**

## 2. üí° Problem Statement

Drivers in the UAE face fragmented toll systems and financial blind spots:

* Separate accounts for **Salik** (Dubai) and **Darb** (Abu Dhabi).
* No unified monthly summary across all vehicles.
* Frequent surprises: **auto top-ups, low balance, or double deductions**.
* Fleet managers lack insight into toll patterns or optimization routes.

**TollSense UAE** bridges this by aggregating data from both systems, offering **real-time toll tracking, AI-driven route savings**, and **predictive expense insights**.

Would you like me to generate next:
